# koa-s3-sign-upload

Middleware for [Koa 2][] to sign AWS S3 upload requests.

Specifically, this middleware is designed to work with [react-s3-uploader][]. Credit is given to [@OKNoah][] for [PR #80][] from which this package is derived.

**Note: Use v2 for compatibility with Koa 1.**

__Install__

```shell
$ npm install -S koa-s3-sign-upload
```

__Usage__

```js
const signS3 = require('koa-s3-sign-upload');

app.use(signS3({
  bucket: 'MyS3Bucket',

  // optional. Prepends this values to all upload keys
  keyPrefix: '',

  // optional. Prepends a random GUID to the `objectName` query parameter
  randomizeFilename: true,

  // optional
  region: 'us-east-1',

  // optional (use for some amazon regions: frankfurt and others)
  signatureVersion: 'v4',

  // optional
  headers: { 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*' },

  // this is default
  ACL: 'private',

  // optional
  accessKeyId: 'foo',

  // optional
  secretAccessKey: 'bar',

  // optional. useful for s3-compatible APIs
  endpoint: 'https://rest.s3alternative.com',

  // optional. default is /s3. useful if you version your API endpoints
  prefix: '/v1/s3',

  // optional. exposes GET /s3/uploads/...
  // which redirects to signed S3 urls
  enableRedirect: true,

  // this is default
  expires: 60
}));
```

With default parameters, this will expose an endpoint `GET /s3/sign` for signing S3 upload requests. The endpoint expects the following query parameters:

* Either `objectName` or `fileName`. If both are provided, `fileName` will be used. This is appended to the `keyPrefix` to form the S3 key. Note that the `randomizeFilename` option will cause the filename to get prepended with a GUID
* `contentType` will be used to set the mime type of the file once uploaded to S3

If `enableRedirect` is set, this will also provide another endpoint: `GET /s3/uploads/(.*)`, which will create a temporary URL that provides access to the uploaded file (which are uploaded privately by default). The request is then redirected to the URL, so that the image is served to the client.

__Access/Secret Keys__

The [aws-sdk][] must be configured with your account's AWS credentials. [There are a number of ways to provide these](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/guide/node-configuring.html). The easiest ways are to either provide them in the options or to set up the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables for the SDK to pick them up.

Note: Best practice in EC2/Lambda is to use an IAM instance/execution role, in which case you must not specify the `accessKeyId` and `secretAccessKey` options, and leave the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` empty.
